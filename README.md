# UIUC-CS-126-Naive-Bayes-Assignment
Cinder C++ project that analyzes an image to see if it contains a number or numbers using Bayes' Theorem for CS 126 at UIUC.

This Cinder C++ project was my final submission for the CS 126 Naive Bayes assignment at UIUC. This assignment was conducted over the course of about two weeks. For this assignment, I received a grade of 74.79% for the first milestone, then 91.25% for the second milestone, which can be seen in the Grade Screenshot. I decided to include the first milestone grade in this README and accompanying screenshot to show my ability to overhaul a project. This was also around the time of both my paternal grandfather's and my dog's passing, which left me quite distraught and of course negatively impacted my ability to work to the point that I received a grade as low as I did for the first milestone. I nonetheless pushed through to not only get myself back in shape but my programming as well.

Disclaimer: The final allowable submission date has long passed, so the ability to use this code to submit the assignment for a grade in the semester of Spring 2021 has similarly passed. I do not condone usage of this project for the purposes of cheating if this exact type of project assignment is to be re-used in future iterations of CS 126 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
